            HTML5 was published as a Working Draft by the W3C.[48] Although its
            syntax closely resembles that of SGML, HTML5 has abandoned any
            attempt to be an SGML application and has explicitly defined its own
            "html" serialization, in addition to an alternative XML-based XHTML5
            serialization On 14 February 2011, the W3C extended the charter of
            its HTML Working Group with clear milestones for HTML5. In May 2011,
            the working group advanced HTML5 to "Last Call", an invitation to
            communities inside and outside W3C to confirm the technical
            soundness of the specification. The W3C developed a comprehensive
            test suite to achieve broad interoperability for the full
            specification by 2014, which was the target date for
            recommendation.[50] In January 2011, the WHATWG renamed its "HTML5"
            living standard to "HTML". The W3C nevertheless continues its
            project to release HTML5.[51] In July 2012, WHATWG and W3C decided
            on a degree of separation. W3C will continue the HTML5 specification
            work, focusing on a single definitive standard, which is considered
            a "snapshot" by WHATWG. The WHATWG organization will continue its
            work with HTML5 as a "Living Standard". The concept of a living
            standard is that it is never complete and is always being updated
            and improved. New features can be added but functionality will not
            be removed.[52] In December 2012, W3C designated HTML5 as a
            Candidate Recommendation.[53] The criterion for advancement to W3C
            Recommendation is "two 100% complete and fully interoperable
            implementations".[54]
